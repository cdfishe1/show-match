## Project Introduction
Show-Match is built in two tow stages. 
Stage 1 (current development) 
The purpose of this development stage is to allow a user to search videos and tv shows.
Then the user can watch tailers of the search results. 
Then the user can decide which movie or show is the choice of entertainment.

Stage 2 (future development):
Two or more users can perform an individual search.
Then the user can select the movies or TV Shows of interest.
Then the App will compare the selection lists 
Then the App will create a list of common selections.
Then the users can decide on the movie / TV shows they want to watch together. 

## User Instructions
The user enters a search criterion in tgit addhe search field.
Then clicks on “search” or presses the enter key.
A maximum of 20 viable search result will be displayed.
Each individual search result includes a button to show a trailer of that movie. 
When clicking the trailer button, a trailer will be displayed.
Each search result will be stored, to enable the user to click on a stored search to review the search result.


Incorrect entrance is displayed to inform the user that the search criteria is either not available or not a match. In this case the user will be requested to enter a new search criterion. 

## Development 
The App includes two different search databases:
1.	The Movie Database (TMDb)
The Movie Database (TMDb) is a popular, user editable database for movies and TV shows.
2.	YouTube

The “TMDb” results are generated via Fetch. 
The YouTube Trailer links are generated via ajax.

The App supports mobile application, using bootstrap.
